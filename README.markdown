### What is CoconutKit?

CoconutKit is a library of high-quality iOS components written at [hortis le studio](http://www.hortis.ch/) and in my spare time. It includes several tools for dealing with view controllers, multi-threading, view animations, as well as some new controls and various utility classes. These components are meant to make the life of an iOS programmer easier by reducing the boilerplate code written every day, improving code quality and enforcing solid application architecture.

Most of CoconutKit components are not meant to be sexy, but rather useful. Do not be freaked out! These components are meant to make you more productive, less focused on debugging, so that you can spend more time working on the design of your application (if you have a great designer at hand, of course!)

CoconutKit is distributed under a permissive [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), which means you can freely use it in your own projects (commercial or not).

### Where can I download CoconutKit?
You can download CoconutKit from [my github page](https://github.com/defagos), both in binary and source forms.

### What can I find in CoconutKit?
CoconutKit provides your with several kinds of classes covering various aspects of iOS development:

* High-quality view controller containers (view controller embedding, view controller stacking) with several transition animations
* Easy way to change the language used by an application at runtime, without having to alter system preferences
* Localization of labels and buttons directly in nib files, without having to create and bind outlets anymore
* Core Data validation made easy: No more boilerplate code to write, which lets you focus on the validation business logic. Moreover, text fields can be bound for field formatting and synchronization, both in model -> view and view -> model directions. Forms filling model objects managed by Core Data have never been easier to write!
* View controllers for web browsing and easier table view search management
* Multi-threaded task management, including task grouping, cancelation, progress status, task dependencies and remaining time estimation
* New controls (text field moving automatically with the keyboard, new kind of segmented control, Ken Burns slideshow)
* Various extensions to Cocoa and UIKit classes (calendrical calculations, collections, notifications, etc.)
* Classes for common UI tasks (keyboard management, interface locking)
* Classes for single-line table view cell and view instantiations
* Classes for creating complex view animations made of several sub-animations
* Methods for skinning some built-in controls prior to iOS 5 appearance API
* Lightweight logger, assertions, float comparisons, etc.
* ... and more!
* ... and even more to come!

### How should I use CoconutKit?
The easiest and recommended way to use CoconutKit is to grab the latest tagged binary package available for download. Right-click on your project, select "Add files", and add the .staticframework directory ("Copy items into destination group's folder" must be turned off, and "Create groups for any added folders" selected). Then **remove the CoconutKit language files your project does not need (see below why)**. Also import the CoconutKit.h header file from your project .pch file (`#import <CoconutKit/CoconutKit.h>`). You are now ready to go!

Note that depending on the CoconutKit components you use you might need to link against one or several of the following frameworks:

* CoreData.framework
* MessageUI.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

Some code snippets have been provided in the Snippets directory (and more will probably be added in the future). Add them to your favorite snippet manager to make working with CoconutKit classes even more easier!

If you enjoy the library, [hortis](http://www.hortis.ch/) and I would sincerely love being credited somewhere in your application, for example on some about page. Thanks for your support!

**It is especially important that your remove those languages you do not need. Fortunately, this is easy to do using Xcode 4: Click on your project, select the info tab and press backspace on each language you want to discard (usually the ones with a lower number of localized files). If you fail to do so you could run into troubles: When a localized file is found, an application is namely assumed to be localized for the corresponding language, even if other files are missing for it. Usually, this means some translations or localized images will be missing. But if you are also using localized nib files your application is likely to crash when your device is set in some language, while it works perfectly when the device language is another one. Removing languages has to be done every time you add a .staticframework file, you should also be careful when updating CoconutKit**

### With which versions of iOS is CoconutKit compatible?
CoconutKit should be compatible with iOS 3.2 and later (this will change as old OS versions get deprecated), both for iPhone and iPad projects. Please file a bug if you discover it is not the case.

### How can I learn using CoconutKit?
Learning how to use CoconutKit components always starts with header documentation. I try to keep documentation close to the code, that is why header documentation is rather extensive. All you need to know should be written there, I avoid external documentation which often gets outdated. After you have read this documentation, have a look at the demos and unit tests to see how the component is used in a concrete case.

### Why have you released CoconutKit?
My company, [hortis](http://www.hortis.ch/), has a long tradition of open source development. This is one of the major reasons why I  started to work for its entity devoted to mobile development, hortis le studio. After months of hard work, I felt the library was getting mature enough to deserve being published. I sincerely hope people will find this work interesting and start contributing code or ideas, so that a fruitful collaboration process can arise.

### Why should I use CoconutKit?
When designing components, I strongly emphasize on clean and documented interfaces, as well as on code quality. My goal is to create components that are easy to use, reliable, and which do what they claim they do, without nasty surprises. You should never have to look at a component implementation to know how it works, this should be obvious just by looking at its interface. I also strive to avoid components that leak or crash. If those are qualities you love to find in libraries, then you should start using CoconutKit now! Moreover, CoconutKit will never use any private API and will therefore always remain AppStore friendly.

### Does CoconutKit use ARC?
No, CoconutKit currently does not use ARC. This will change in the future as ARC is adopted. Because of the large code base and features currently still in development, I am currently not able to start the conversion process immediately. This should however happen somewhere in 2012.

### Can I contribute?
You can, and you are strongly encouraged to. Use github pull requests to submit your improvements and bug fixes. You can submit everything you want, documentation and comment fixes included! Everything that tends to increase code quality is always warmly welcome.

There are some requirements when contributing, though:

* Code style guidelines are not formalized anywhere, but try to stay as close as possible to the style I use. This saves me some work when merging pull requests. IMHO, having a consistent way of organizing and writing source code makes it easier to read, write and maintain
* Read my [article about the memory management techniques](http://subjective-objective-c.blogspot.com/2011/04/use-objective-c-properties-to-manage.html) I use, and apply the same rules
* Use of private APIs is strictly forbidden
* Development and demo projects are also included. Both are almost the same, except that the demo project uses the library in its binary form. New components should be written using the development project, so that an example with good code coverage is automatically available when your new component is ready. The demo project should then be updated accordingly

### How can I build CoconutKit?
CoconutKit is meant to be built into a .staticframework package using the [make-fmwk command](https://github.com/defagos/make-fmwk). After having installed the command somewhere in your path, run it from the CoconutKit static library project directory (see below), as follows:

    make-fmwk.sh -o <output_directory> -u <version> Release
    make-fmwk.sh -o <output_directory> -u <version> Debug
    
e.g.

    make-fmwk.sh -o ~/MyBuilds -u 1.0 Release
    make-fmwk.sh -o ~/MyBuilds -u 1.0 Debug

### How can I write code for CoconutKit?
After checking out the code, open the Xcode 4 workspace. Four projects have been created:

* CoconutKit: The project used to build the CoconutKit static library
* CoconutKit-demo: The project used to test the CoconutKit .staticframework package. This project is mostly used to check that no linker issues arise
* CoconutKit-dev: The project used when working on CoconutKit. This project is an almost empty shell referencing files from both the CoconutKit and CoconutKit-demo projects
* CoconutKit-test: The project used for writing unit tests. This project references files from the CoconutKit project

Use the CoconutKit-dev project to easily write and test your code. When you are done with the CoconutKit project, update the CoconutKit and CoconutKit-demo projects to mirror the changes you made to the source and resource file list. Any new public header file must be added to CoconutKit-dev pch file, as well as to the publicHeaders.txt file located in the CoconutKit-dev directory. Source files with link issues (source files containing categories only, or meant to be used in Interface Builder) must also be added to the bootstrap.txt file. Please refer to the make-fmwk.sh documentation for more information.

For "non-interactive" components, you should consider adding some test cases to the CoconutKit-test project as well. Update it to mirror the changes made to the source and resource files of the CoconutKit project, and update the .pch to reference any new public header.

To build the CoconutKit .staticframework packages needed by the CoconutKit-demo and CoconutKit-test projects, proceed as follows:

* Build the trunk CoconutKit .staticframework packages into /LeStudioSDK/Binaries/CoconutKit (this is the standard directory which we use at hortis le studio). Run the following commands from the CoconutKit static library project directory:
  * `make-fmwk.sh -o /LeStudioSDK/Binaries/CoconutKit -u trunk Release`
  * `make-fmwk.sh -o /LeStudioSDK/Binaries/CoconutKit -u trunk Debug`
* If the resource list has changed, you must remove CoconutKit-trunk-Release.staticframework from both the CoconutKit-demo and CoconutKit-test projects, then the one you just built
* Build the CoconutKit-demo and CoconutKit-test projects and run them to test your code

The CoconutKit-test project also requires the [GHUnit framework](https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit) GHUnitIOS.framework to be installed under /Developer/Frameworks.

### Why are all classes prefixed with HLS?
HLS stands for hortis le studio.
