/**
 * A weak reference to an object, which gets automatically set to nil when the object it refers to is
 * deallocated. This is a convenient way to eliminate the crashes usually associated with dangling 
 * pointers. Unlike ARC zeroing weak references, though, HLSZeroingWeakRef objects also provide a
 * way to execute custom code before the reference is zeroed. This is especially useful when it makes
 * sense to proactively stop some process whose delegate gets deallocated, for example.
 *
 * HLSZeroingWeakRef instances must be retained by the objects which store them.
 *
 * The current implementation of HLSZeroingWeakRef is fairly basic:
 *   - zeroing weak references to toll-free bridged objects (NSString, NSURL, NSNumber, etc.) are not 
 *     supported. Attempting to initialize a zeroing weak with a toll-free bridged object results in 
 *     an exception being thrown
 *   - thread-safety issues have been ignored
 *
 * This implementation should suffice in most cases (weak pointers to instances of custom Objective-C 
 * classes, accessed from a single thread). In other cases, consider using Mike Ash implementation
 * found at https://github.com/mikeash/MAZeroingWeakRef or ARC zeroing weak references.
