/**
 * Test workflow:
 * --------------
 * To understand this code, create a form with at least two HLSTextFields, supporting all orientations. Then debug the 
 * code using the following test workflow (covering all possible cases). Setting a breakpoint on each method can
 * help you understand when each method gets called and why:
 *   1) With the keyboard dismissed, click on a field A (A receives becomeFirstResponder)
 *   2) Rotate the device (keyboardWillHide, then keyboardWillShow are called for A)
 *   3) Click on another field B (B receives becomeFirstResponder, which calls resignFirstResponder on A)
 *   4) Rotate the device (keyboardWillHide, then keyboardWillShow are called for B)
 *   5) Dismiss the keyboard (B receives resignFirstResponder)

/**
 * Keep a reference to the currently active HLSTextField (if any) and to its original offset. This is safe since UIKit 
 * is not meant to be used in multi-threaded code. Moreover, at most one text field can be active at any time, and there 
 * is no risk of dangling pointers (a viewDidUnload, which would invalidate the ref we keep, can only appear
 * when the view is not visible, i.e. when no text field is active)
 *
 * Saving the original offset (and not the total offset which is applied) is made on purpose. Since we have very little
 * control over offset animations, offset animations which not have ended when other are started (especially when we
 * fast switch between fields in the iOS simulator). In such cases the total offset gets unreliable.

/**
 * When a text field must be made visible, we climb up the view hierarchy to find the bottommost scroll view (i.e. the 
 * one which is not contained in any other scroll view). This is the one we adjust to make the field visible. Originally
 * the nearest parent scroll view of a text field was used, but this was a bad idea (it is easier to couple scroll
 * view motions vertically if using the bottommost one)
 *
 * Remark:
 * To keep a field visible, some implementations directly move the parent view (not the content offset of a scroll view).
 * This is only possible in a view controller implementation, where the UI appearance is precisely known (since managed 
 * by the view controller). Here, to get the same behavior without a using view controller (i.e. we cannot know how the UI is
 * supposed to look, which fields are grouped, etc.), we cannot simply adjust the parent view frame. What we need is a
 * way to identify which view up the caller hierarchy can be adjusted when some of its content needs to stay visible. 
 * The most natural such object is the scroll view.
