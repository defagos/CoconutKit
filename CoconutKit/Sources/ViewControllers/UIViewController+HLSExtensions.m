/**
 * Remark: We have NOT overridden the view property to perform the viewDidUnload, and on purpose. This would have been
 *         very convenient, but this would have been unusual and in most cases the viewDidUnload would have
 *         been sent twice (when a container controller nils a view it manages, it is likely it will set the view
 *         to nil and send it the viewDidUnload afterwards. If all view controller containers of the world knew
 *         about HLSViewController, this would work, but since they don't this would lead to viewDidUnload be
 *         called twice in most cases)!
