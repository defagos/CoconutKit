/**
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is a collection of animation steps (HLSAnimationStep), each representing collective changes
 * applied to sets of views during some time interval. An HLSAnimation object simply chains those changes together to play 
 * a complete animation. It also provides a convenient way to generate the corresponding reverse animation.
 *
 * Unlike UIView animation blocks, the animation delegate is not retained. This safety measure is not needed since
 * an HLSAnimation is automatically cancelled if it has a delegate and the delegate is deallocated. This eliminates
 * the need to cancel the animation manually when the delegate is destroyed.
 *
 * Animations can be played animated or not (yeah, that sounds weird, but I called it that way :-) ). When played
 * non-animated, an animation reaches its end state instantaneously. This is a perfect way to replay an animation
 * when rebuilding a view which has been unloaded (typically after a memory warning has been received). Animation
 * steps with duration equal to 0 also occur instantaneously.
 *
 * Delegate methods can be implemented by clients to catch animation events. An animated boolean value is received
 * in each of them, corresponding to how playAnimated: was called. For steps whose duration is 0, the boolean is
 * also YES if the animation was run using playAnimated:YES (even though the step was not animated, it is still
 * part of an animation which was played animated).
 *
 * If the resizeViews property is set to YES, an animation alters the frames of the involved views. If this property 
 * is set to NO, the animation only alters the view transforms, which means the views will be stretched. View resizing 
 * is currently quite experimental and is therefore disabled by default.
 *
 * When resizeViews is set to YES, only translation and scale transforms can be applied since the frame is involved.
 * Other transforms will be ignored, and a warning message will be logged
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithAnimationSteps:
