/**
 * HLSRestrictedInterfaceProxy allows the easy creation of lightweight proxy objects through which interaction 
 * with the underlying object only happens through a restricted subset of its class interface. The restricted
 * interface subset is defined using a protocol. Such protocols in general only contain @required methods, but
 * @optional methods can appear as well (in the latter case, the caller is must check whether the proxy object 
 * responds to the method before calling it). Note that restriction only makes sense for instance methods. Your
 * protocols can contain class methods, but they will be meaningless in the context of the proxy object.
 *
 * A typical use case is a mutable object which you want to make immutable, without having to implement a
 * dedicated immutable class. This is easily achieved by defining a readonly proxy interface protocol
 * (i.e. exposing accessor methods only) and returning the proxy object, instead of the underlying mutable
 * object, for which mutability must be prevented.
 *
 * Proxy objects can therefore be useful when carefully designing immutable classes, namely by having public
 * methods return only immutable objects or readonly proxies to immutable internal objects.
 *
 * When creating a proxy object, a protocol informally compatible with the target class must be provided. By 
 * informally we mean that the target class must implement at least all methods @required by the protocol. Calls
 * to non-implemented @optional methods will crash, callers must therefore test whether the proxy object responds 
 * to @optional selectors before calling them.
 *
 * The proxy object introduces an additionaly safety indirection layer in comparison to the brute-force approach
 * of C-casting to id<RestrictedProtocol>. The later approach would namely lead to compile-time errors, but it 
 * is still easy to cast the object back to its original identity (either by mistake or on purpose), allowing 
 * access to the unrestricted interface.
 *
 * The proxy object does not retain the object it is created from, and if the object gets deallocated, all 
 * associated proxy objects are automatically set to nil.
