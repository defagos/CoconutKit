 * points in time) without time zone consideration issues
 *
 * Example:
 * In 2012, the CET -> CEST transition occurs at 2012-03-25 03:00:00 (CEST, UTC+2) for the Europe/Zurich time zone. If you
 * want to add a time interval corresponding to 1 day (86400 seconds) to 2012-03-24 06:00:00 (CET, UTC+1), you now have two
 * options depending on which behavior you require:
 *   - if you use -[NSDate dateByAddingTimeInterval:toDate:], an hour is lost during the transition, and you obtain
 *     2012-03-25 07:00:00 (CEST, UTC+2)
 *   - if you use -dateByAddingTimeInterval:toDate:, a one-hour correction is applied to "negate" the transition.
 *     In the end you obtain 2012-03-25 06:00:00 (CEST, UTC+2)

 *     waas replaced by 03:00:00 UTC+2)
 *   - if you use -timeIntervalBetweenDate:andDate:, you get 7200, i.e. 2 hours (this is the difference between 03:00:00
 *     and 01:00:00, where the CET -> CEST jump has been negated)
