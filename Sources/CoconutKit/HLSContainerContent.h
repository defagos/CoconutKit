/**
 * View controllers inserted into view controller containers exhibit common properties:
 *   - they belong to a container, which they must be able to identify, and they should not be inserted into several
 *     containers at the same time
 *   - they are inserted into a container with some transition animation, and removed from it with the corresponding
 *     reverse animation
 *   - a child view controller's view should be created lazily at the time it is really required
 *   - it must be possible to preload a view controller container before it gets actually displayed (i.e. before the
 *     container view is loaded)
 *   - a view controller container must retain the child view controllers it manages
 *   - a view controller's view properties should be restored when it is removed from a container. It might namely
 *     happen that a client caches this view controller for later reuse
 *   - animations should always be able to assume that view controller's views have alpha = 1.f (this makes implementing
 *     them easy since this does not require any knowledge about the view controller's view alpha). This issue is solved
 *     by having HLSContainerContent always wrap view controller's views within an invisible view having alpha = 1.f
 *   - a child view controller's view must be adjusted to fill the entire container view it is drawn in. This matches
 *     the behavior of standard UIKit containers (UINavigationController, UITabBarController, etc.)
 *   - view lifecycle and rotation events must be forwarded correctly from the container to the contained view controllers
 *   - the view controller containment chain must be preserved, so that view controller properties can be automatically
 *     forwarded from a child to its parent (and higher up in the view controller hierarchy if this parent is itself
 *     embedded into a container). This makes it possible for a navigation controller to use relevant child view controller 
 *     properties when it displays the corresponding parent view controller, for example. Moreover, this ensures that when 
 *     a child view controller presents another view controller modally, it is actually its furthest ancestor who does. 
 *     Finally, this guarantees that the -[UIViewController interfaceOrientation] method returns a correct result
 *   - the iOS containment API defines methods -[UIViewController isMovingTo/FromParentViewController] so that
 *     a child knows when it is inserted or removed from a container. These methods must return a correct result
 *     for custom containers as well
 *   - when a view controller is removed from a container, its view must not be released. This lets clients decide whether
 *     they want to cache the associated view (by retaining the view controller elsewhere) or not (if the view controller
 *     is not retained elsewhere, it will simply be deallocated when it gets removed from the container, and so will be 
 *     its view)
 *
 * The private HLSContainerContent class provides a way to ensure that all above common properties can be easily 
 * fulfilled. It can be seen as some kind of smart pointer object, keeping ownership of a view controller as long
 * as it belongs to a container, and destroyed when the view controller is removed from the container (the view
 * controller itself might be retained elsewhere for caching purposes, though). All interactions with a child view 
 * controller must happen through the HLSContainerContent interface to guarantee proper status tracking and to 
 * ensure that the view is created when it is really needed, not earlier.
 *
 * HLSContainerContent can only be used when implementing containers for which automatic view lifecycle event forwarding
 * has been disabled, i.e. for which -[UIViewController shouldAutomaticallyForwardAppearanceMethods] method returns NO.
