 * direction are optional and might fail, in which case a corresponding error should be returned (most probably
 * they correspond to some kind of parsing)
 *
 * Transformers can be seen as a more general NSFormatter, though they are not limited to formatting / parsing.
 * For example, you can define an NSNumber to NSNumber transformer applying some kind of calculation to it. During
 * forward transformation, some information might get lost (e.g. through rounding), in which case implementing
 * a reverse transformation does not make sense. In other cases (e.g. multiplication with a constant factor), the
 * reverse transformation can be meaningfully implemented. The rule should be that applying the transform and 
 * reverse transform to some object should return an object equal to it
 *
 * Remark: Foundation provides NSValueTransformer, which provides a similar kind of functionality, but requires
 *         subclassing
