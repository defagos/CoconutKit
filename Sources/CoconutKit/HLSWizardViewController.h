/**
 * Controller made of pages building a wizard interface. Each page is a separate view controller you must
 * provide. The appearance of the view controller (as well as its behavior under rotation) is customized by 
 * inheriting from it. As for UIViewController, this class is therefore not meant to be instantiated directly.
 *
 * As for UIViewController, if -init is called instead of the designated initalizer, a xib with the same name
 * as the derived class will be searched in the main bundle (the interface can also be created programmatically,
 * of course).
 *
 * The appearance of the wizard is freely customized using the IBOutlets defined by its public interface,
 * either hooking them using Interface Builder or programmatically. No cancel mechanism is provided, the 
 * subclass is responsible of implementing one if needed.
 *
 * When trying to move to a next page, and if the view controller currently displayed implements the
 * HLSValidable protocol, the page is checked for validity before displaying the next one. Similarly
 * when clicking on the "done" button. If the page does not implement this protocol, the page is
 * always assumed to be valid.
