/**
 * HLSAnimation is the simplest way to create and manage complex animations made of Core Animation-based layer
 * and / or UIView-based animations. Usually, creating complex animations made of several steps requires the
 * implementation of delegate methods, where animations are glued together. This makes your code ugly and difficult
 * to maintain. Moreover, it is painful to create a reverse animation (e.g. when toggling a menu), to pause
 * and cancel animations properly, or to play such animations instantaneously to restore some view state.
 *
 * To eliminate all those issues and provide a convenient way to create animations for your applications, HLSAnimations
 * are defined in a declarative way when instantiated, can be stored, replayed, reversed, cancelled, paused, played
 * instantaneously, slowed down in the iOS simulator, and more. Implementing and tweaking animations has never been 
 * easier and fun!
 *
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is a collection of animation steps (HLSAnimationStep), each representing collective
 * changes applied to sets of views or layers during some time interval. An HLSAnimation object simply chains those 
 * changes together to play a complete animation. An HLSAnimation can be made of view-based animation steps 
 * (HLSViewAnimationStep) or layer-based animation steps (HLSLayerAnimationStep). You can mix both types of animation 
 * steps within the same animation, but you must not alter a view involved both in a view and in a layer animation steps, 
 * otherwise the behavior is undefined. In general, you should use HLSLayerAnimationSteps most of the time, except if 
 * you want to animate a view whose contents must resize appropriately (in which case you must use an HLSViewAnimationStep)
 *
 * Unlike UIView animation blocks, the animation delegate is not retained. This safety measure is not needed since
 * an HLSAnimation is automatically cancelled if it has a delegate and this delegate is deallocated. This eliminates
 * the need to cancel the animation manually when the delegate is destroyed (except, of course, if no delegate has
 * been defined)
 *
 * Animations can be played animated or not (yeah, that sounds weird, but I called it that way :-) ). When played
 * non-animated, an animation reaches its end state instantaneously.
 *
 * Running animations (this includes animations which have been paused) are automatically paused and resumed (if they
 * were running before) when the application enters, respectively exits background. Note that this mechanism works 
 * perfectly within the iOS simulator and on the device, though views will appear to "jump" on the device and on
 * iOS simulators. This is not a bug and has no negative effect on the animation behavior (in particular, delegate 
 * methods are still called correctly), but is a consequence of the application screenshot which is displayed when 
 * the application exits background. The screenshot made when the application enters background namely reflects the
 * non-animated view / layer state, which explains why the views seem to jump.
 *
 * Delegate methods / blocks can be implemented by clients to catch animation events. An animated boolean value is 
 * received in each of them, corresponding to how the play method was called. For steps whose duration is 0, the 
 * boolean is also YES if the animation was run with animated = YES (even though the step was not actually animated, 
 * it is still part of an animation which was played animated).
