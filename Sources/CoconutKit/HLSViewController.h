/**
 * Lightweight view controller subclass adding useful stuff to UIViewController, and which should be always used as 
 * base class when creating view controller subclasses in projects using CoconutKit (provided you do not have to 
 * subclass an existing view controller subclass which does not inherit from HLSViewController, of course).
 *
 * HLSViewController provides you with the following features:
 *   - localization is isolated in a single method. This is not only convenient to have a single place for localization code, 
 *     but this also makes HLSViewController compatible with the NSBundle+HLSDynamicLocalization.h class extension, making
 *     it possible to change a view controller localization at runtime (if this is not needed, HLSViewController of course
 *     remains compatible with the usual way of changing localization via system preferences, but it is stil good practice
 *     to collect localization code in a single method anyway)
 *   - instead of the default nib resolution mechanism of -[UIViewController init] (for @class MyViewController, first
 *     locate MyView.nib, then MyViewController.nib), HLSViewController subclasses look for either a storyboard or a nib 
 *     bearing the same name as the class or one of its superclasses (if no match is found the view controller is assumed 
 *     to be instantiated programmatically). This promotes a consistent naming scheme between source and interface design 
 *     files
 *   - the way how methods must be overridden is clean and consistent: The rule is now "Always call the super implementation
 *     first" (if failing to do so, the behavior is undefined). This includes all view lifecycle methods, rotation methods,
 *     as well as -localize and -didReceiveMemoryWarning
 *
 * The HLSViewController class is not meant to be instantiated directly, you should subclass it to define your own view
 * controllers.
 *
 * The current Apple recommended way to instantiate view controllers is using storyboards. Though they let you define your
 * view hierarchy on a single screen, storyboards have a few drawbacks:
 *   - they tend to scatter code around, most notably when you want to want to tweak how segues connect view controllers
 *   - even if you break your hierarchy into several storyboards, a single storyboard containing usually contains several 
 *     view controllers. Such a file can be a hot spot when working within a team of developers, and can lead to nightmares
 *     when merging changes
 *
 * This is why you might prefer view instantiation using nib files associated with each view controllers, an approach which
 * has its own drawbacks as well:
 *   - you cannot use prototype cells
 *   - you cannot layout your views using top and bottom layout guides
 *
 * CoconutKit instantiation mechanism solves these issues by letting you instantiate a view controller from an associated
 * storyboard. This still lets you have a separate interface design file for each view controller, while letting you use
 * prototype cells and layout guides.
