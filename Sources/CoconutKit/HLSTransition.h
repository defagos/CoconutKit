// Default duration for a transition animation. This is a reserved value and corresponds to the intrinsic duration
// of an animation as defined by its implementation
OBJC_EXPORT const NSTimeInterval kAnimationTransitionDefaultDuration;

/**
 * Base class for transition animations involving two views (currently for use by containers). To define your
 * own transition animation, subclass HLSTransition and implement the
 *   -layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inView:withBounds:
 * method to return the HLSAnimationSteps to be played when a view is brought to display, while another one is hidden
 * from view. You can also optionally implement the
 *   -reverseLayerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inView:withBounds:
 * method (which by default returns nil) to define the animation to be used when performing the reverse transition.
 *
 * When implementing -layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inView:withBounds: (and its reverse counterpart),
 * keep in mind that:
 *   - appearingView, disappearingView and view must not be altered directly (in particular, you must not change their
 *     current bounds, transform or alpha directly). Those view parameters are only provided so that they can be supplied
 *     to
 *       -[HLSAnimationStep addViewAnimationStep:forView:]
 *     when building the animation steps. Only the transition animation is allowed to perform changes on those views
 *     when it gets played
 *   - when implementing -layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:disappearingView:inView:withBounds:, create your animation
 *     steps based on the folowing assumptions:
 *       - appearingView, disappearingView and view all have the received bounds parameter as bounds. Note that the
 *         real appearingView.bounds, disappearingView.bounds and view.bounds might be different, but you should not
 *         use read and use those properties when implementing your animation.
 *         You can e.g. use the dimensions of bounds to translate the appearing and / or disappearing views outside
 *         the view if your animation requires it
 *       - both appearingView and disappearingView have alpha = 1.f
 *       - the layer properties are the default ones for a CALayer (e.g. rasterization is disabled)
 *       - appearingView is on top of disappearingView, and both are displayed within view
 *     If you need your appearing view to start from a different initial state, use a first "setup" animation step
 *     with duration = 0. This way you can make it initially invisible or outside the frame. Conversely, you can
 *     add a final animation step to make the disappearing view invisible at the end of the animation (this might
 *     be required for animations moving the disappearing view outside the view, so that it stays invisible when
 *     subsequent animations are played)
 *   - your transition animations will in general animate appearingView and disappearingView. You can also animate
 *     view as well if needed, most notably to alter its sublayer transform, e.g. when adding perspective to
 *     appearingView and disappearingView animations
 *   - the duration of your animation steps is arbitrary. The sum of those durations defines the default duration
 *     of the resulting animation, which can be retrieved by calling the +defaultDuration method on a transition
 *     class. The duration of each animation step might be scaled depending on the total duration which is desired
 *     when the animation is actually played (refer to -[HLSAnimation animationWithDuration:] documentation for more
 *     information)
 *
 * For example, here is the implementation of a push from right animation (the usual UINavigationController animation)
 * with an intrinsic duration of 0.4:
 *
 *   + (NSArray<HLSAnimationStep *> *)layerAnimationStepsWithAppearingView:(UIView *)appearingView
 *                                                        disappearingView:(UIView *)disappearingView
 *                                                                  inView:(UIView *)view
 *                                                              withBounds:(CGRect)bounds
 *   {
 *       NSMutableArray *animationSteps = [NSMutableArray array];
 *
 *       // Setup step initially bringing the appearing view outside the view
 *       HLSAnimationStep *animationStep1 = [HLSAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSViewAnimationStep *viewAnimationStep11 = [HLSViewAnimationStep viewAnimationStep];
 *       [viewAnimationStep11 translateByVectorWithX:CGRectGetWidth(bounds) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep1 addViewAnimationStep:viewAnimationStep11 forView:appearingView];
 *       animationStep1.duration = 0.;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep1];
 *
 *       // The push itself, moving both views to the left
 *       HLSAnimationStep *animationStep2 = [HLSAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSViewAnimationStep *viewAnimationStep21 = [HLSViewAnimationStep viewAnimationStep];
 *       [viewAnimationStep21 translateByVectorWithX:-CGRectGetWidth(bounds) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep2 addViewAnimationStep:viewAnimationStep21 forView:disappearingView];
 *       HLSViewAnimationStep *viewAnimationStep22 = [HLSViewAnimationStep viewAnimationStep];
 *       [viewAnimationStep22 translateByVectorWithX:-CGRectGetWidth(bounds) y:0.f z:0.f];
 *       [animationStep2 addViewAnimationStep:viewAnimationStep22 forView:appearingView];
 *       animationStep2.duration = 0.4;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep2];
 *
 *       // Make the disappearing view invisible
 *       HLSAnimationStep *animationStep3 = [HLSAnimationStep animationStep];
 *       HLSViewAnimationStep *viewAnimationStep31 = [HLSViewAnimationStep viewAnimationStep];
 *       viewAnimationStep31.alphaVariation = -1.f;
 *       [animationStep3 addViewAnimationStep:viewAnimationStep31 forView:disappearingView];
 *       animationStep3.duration = 0.;
 *       [animationSteps addObject:animationStep3];
 *
 *       return [animationSteps copy];
 *   }
 *
 * Have a look at the CoconutKit source code for more examples (HLSTransition.m). Several built-in transition classes are
 * provided by CoconutKit and should fulfill most of your needs.
