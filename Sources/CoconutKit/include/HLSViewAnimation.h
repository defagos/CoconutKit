/**
 * A view animation (HLSViewAnimation) describes the changes applied to a view within an animation step 
 * (HLSViewAnimationStep). An animation step is the combination of several view animations applied
 * to a set of views, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval. 
 * An animation (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation steps, either view-based
 * (HLSViewAnimationStep) or layer-based (HLSLayerAnimationStep).
 *
 * Note that a view animation:
 *   - animates view frames. The animated views have to correctly respond to such changes, either by setting
 *     their autoresizing mask properly, or by implementing -layoutSubviews if they need a finer control
 *     over the resizing process
 *   - applies only affine operations
 *
 * In general, and if you do not need to animate view frames to resize subviews during animations, you should 
 * use layer animations instead of view animations since they have far more capabilities.
