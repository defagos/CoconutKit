/**
 * The HLSContainerStack provides a convenient and easy interface to implement your own view controller containers,
 * which is usually not a trivial task. This class is provides powerful features which let you implement custom 
 * containers correctly in a snap. The iOS containment API, though powerful, namely still requires a lot of work
 * to implement perfect containers. This is not the case with HLSContainerStack, which provides a robust way to 
 * implement the containers of your dreams.
 *
 * A lot of work has been made to provide a clean and powerful interface letting you easily implement containers with
 * correct behavior. Most notably:
 *   - view lifecycle and rotation events are correctly forwarded to children view controllers
 *     Remark: Even if a view controller remains visible behind a transparent top view controller on top of it, it will
 *             still be considered as having disappeared (and therefore will receive the -viewWillDisappear: and 
 *             -viewDidDisappear: events). It would namely be difficult and costly to determine if part of a view 
 *             controller's view is visible through the view controller hierarchy on top of it (this would require
 *             finding the intersections of all view and subview rectangles, multiplicating alphas to find which 
 *             parts of the view are visible and which aren't; clearly not worth it).
 *   - custom animations can be provided when inserting view controllers into a stack. A standard set of
 *     animations is provided out of the box. Animations behave correctly in all cases, even if the stack
 *     was rotated between push and pop operations, or if views have been unloaded
 *   - a delegate (usually your container implementation) can register itself with a stack to be notified when 
 *     a view controller gets pushed, popped, appears or disappears. The set of delegate methods which can be 
 *     implemented is far richer than the ones of UIKit built-in containers (most notably UINavigationController). 
 *     Your custom containers usually just need to forward the events their users might be interested in through a
 *     dedicated delegate protocol
 *   - the methods -[UIViewController isMovingTo/FromParentViewController] return correct results, consistent
 *     with those returned when using standard built-in UIKit containers
 *   - a capacity can be provided so that children view controller's views deep enough are automatically removed
 *     from the view hierarchy and reinserted when needed. The reason is that having too many view non-opaque
 *     view controllers can lead to performance issues, especially during animations (due to layer blending).
 *     By limiting the number of views in the container view hierarchy, such issues can be kept under control.
 *     Alternatively, a view controller can be removed from the stack as soon as it gets deep enough. This makes 
 *     it possible to implement containers with a FIFO behavior (the case where the capacity is set to 1 corresponds 
 *     to a stack displaying a single child view controller). Usually, the default capacity (which is given by
 *     HLSContainerStackDefaultCapacity = 2) should fulfill most needs, but if you require more transparency levels
 *     you can increase this value. Standard capacity values are provided at the beginning of this file.
 *   - custom containers implemented using HLSContainerStack behave correctly, whether they are embedded into 
 *     another container (even built-in ones), displayed as the root of an application, or modally
 *   - stacks can be used to display any kind of view controllers, even standard UIKit containers like
 *     UITabBarController or UINavigationController
 *   - custom containers can be nested to create any kind of application workflow
 *   - view controllers can be preloaded into a stack before it is actually displayed
 *   - view controllers can be inserted into or removed from a stack at any position. Methods have been supplied
 *     to pop to a given view controller (even the root one) or to remove all view controllers at once
 *   - children view controller's views are instantiated right when needed, avoding waste of memory
 *   - view controllers are owned by a stack, but if you need to cache some of them for performance reasons,
 *     you still can: Simply keep and manage an external strong reference to the view controllers you want to cache
 *   - storyboards are supported. You are responsible of implementing segues in your own container implementations, 
 *     though (see HLSPlaceholderViewController.m and HLSStackController.m for examples)
 *   - view controller containment relationships are consistent with those expected from UIKit built-in containers.
 *     In particular, some properties are automatically forwarded from a child view controller to a navigation
 *     controller if it displays a custom container, and modal view controllers are presented by the furthest
 *     ancestor container
 *   - a custom container can contain several HLSContainerStacks if it needs to display several children view
 *     controllers simultaneously
 *   - the container view can be resized at will, even when child view controllers are displayed
 *
 * When implementing your own view controller container, be sure to call the following HLSContainerStack
 * methods, otherwise the behavior is undefined (refer to the documentation of these methods for more 
 * information):
 *     -viewWillAppear:
 *     -viewDidAppear:
 *     -viewWillDisappear:
 *     -viewDidDisappear:
 *
 * Also do not forget to set a containerView, either in your container -loadView or -viewDidLoad methods
 *
 * Even though the iOS containment API is promising, implementing your own view controllers using
 * HLSContainerStack has many advantages, and is far easier. For examples of implementations, have a look 
 * at HLSStackController.m and HLSPlaceholderViewController.m. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
