/**
 * We often need to manage a stack of view controllers. Usually, we use a navigation controller, but there is no way
 * to easily use other transition animations as the built-in ones. Sometimes, we also want to show view controllers
 * modally, but often the usual -presentViewController:animated:completion: method of UIViewController is too limited. 
 *
 * To circumvent those problems, HLSStackController provides a generic way to deal with a view controller stack, whose
 * root view is fixed and set once at creation time. It can be applied a richer set of transition animations, even
 * custom ones. As UINavigationController and UITabBarController, HLSStackController is not meant to be subclassed.
 *
 * When a view controller's view is inserted into a stack controller, its view frame is automatically adjusted to match 
 * the container view bounds, as is the case with usual UIKit containers (UITabBarController, UINavigationController). 
 * Be sure that the view controller's view size and autoresizing behaviors are correctly set.
 *
 * You can resize or move (even animate!) the stack container view, even when children are displayed. This makes the
 * creation of innovative user interfaces as easy as it can be.
 *
 * Since a stack controller can manage many view controller's views, and since in general only the first few top ones
 * need to be visible, it would be a waste of resources to keep all views loaded at any time. At creation time, the
 * maximal number of view controllers whose views are added to the container view hierarchy ("capacity") can be provided. 
 * By default, the capacity is set to 2, which means that the container guarantees that at most the two top view controller's 
 * views appear in the container view hierarchy. The container simply removes the view controller's views below in the stack 
 * to minimize blending calculations. Usually, the default value should fulfill most needs, but if you require more transparency 
 * levels you can increase this value. Standard capacity values are provided at the beginning of the HLSContainerStack.h file.
 *
 * You can also use stack controllers with storyboards:
 *   - drop a view controller onto the storyboard, and set its class to HLSStackController. You can customize the
 *     view controller capacity by setting an NSNumber user-defined runtime attribute called 'capacity'
 *   - drop another view controller onto the storyboard, and set it as root view controller of the stack by
 *     binding the stack controller with it using an HLSStackPushSegue called 'hls_root'. The transition style which
 *     gets applied is always HLSTransitionStyleNone and cannot be customized
 *   - if you want to push another view controller, drop a view controller onto the storyboard, and connect the 
 *     root view controller with it using another HLSStackPushSegue (with any non-reserved identifier). If you 
 *     need to customize transition settings (e.g. style and duration), you must implement the -prepareForSegue:sender: 
 *     method in your source view controller (the root view controller in this example)
 *   - segues only go one way (as for UINavigationController ones: A segue connection always allocates the 
 *     destination view controller, and thus cannot be bound to existing destinations, refer to the UIStoryboardSegue
 *     documentation for more information). If you want to pop a view controller, you therefore have to do it
 *     programmatically
 * For further information, refer to the documentation of HLSStackPushSegue.
