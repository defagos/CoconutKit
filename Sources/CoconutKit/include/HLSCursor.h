/**
 * A class for creating value cursors, i.e. sets of elements from which one is exactly active at any time. The current 
 * element is identified by a graphical pointer. This pointer can either be moved by clicking another value or by dragging
 * it.
 *
 * Adding a cursor to your application is very easy:
 *   - add a HLSCursor, either programmatically or using Interface Builder
 *   - implement a data source (HLSCursorDataSource protocol) to set the elements to display
 *   - implement a delegate (HLSCursorDelegate protocol) to respond to cursor events
 *
 * The cursor layout is automatically created for you: You just need to set the main cursor frame size, the layout is
 * calculated for you depending on the size of the elements which need to be displayed. During development, if you use the
 * debug version of the library, warnings will be displayed in the console if the frame is too small to display the cursor
 * contents correctly (see HLSLogger for the available logging levels).
 *
 * There are two ways to set the cursor contents. Both can be mixed within the same cursor:
 *   - basic: You just set the text and basic text properties (font, colors, shadows)
 *   - custom: Each element is a view and can be customized using Interface Builder
 * Cursors using both ways of customisation can coexist in the same source file.
 *
 * Remark: If the cursor is placed inside a scroll view, you might need to set canCancelContentTouches on it so that
 *         dragging the pointer view can work as expected
 *
 * Binding support for HLSCursor:
 *   - binds to NSNumber model values
 *   - displays and updates the underlying model value
 *   - can animate updates

/**
 * The pointer view, which can either be set programmatically or using a xib. If nil, the default pointer will be used.
 * If you use a custom view, be sure it can stretch properly since the pointer view frame will be adjusted depending
 * on the element it is on. In general, your custom pointer view is likely to be transparent so that the element
 * below it can be seen.
 *
 * As soon as the pointer view has been set it cannot be changed anymore.
