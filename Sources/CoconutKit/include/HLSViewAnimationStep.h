 * A view animation step (HLSViewAnimationStep) is the combination of several view animations (HLSViewAnimation) applied

 * (HLSLayerAnimationStep).
 *
 * To create a view animation step, simply instantiate it using the +animationStep class method, then add view animations
 * to it, and set its duration and curve
