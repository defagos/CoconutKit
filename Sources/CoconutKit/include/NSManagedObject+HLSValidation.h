NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/**
 * Writing Core Data validations is cumbersome, error-prone and ultimately painful. Though the initial idea 
 * is good (writing a set of methods beginning with 'validate' and which perform individual and consistency
 * validations), there are several issues which make writing object validations rather inconvenient
 * (read http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdValidation.html
 * for more information):
 *   - the parameter received by the validation methods is an object pointer, not an object. Having to
 *     dereference an object is ugly (moreover, the pointer itself must be tested against NULL before
 *     dereferencing it), and even uglier given the fact the documentation says you should never use this
 *     reference to alter the object
 *   - when implementing the consistency validation methods (called when inserts, updates or deletions are
 *     committed), the super methods must always be called by subclasses. If done improperly along the managed
 *     object hierarchy, i.e. if the NSManagedObject implementation of the consistency methods is not
 *     ultimately called for some objects, then neither will their individual validation methods
 *   - validation methods implemented on model object classes are called when a managed object context
 *     containing a modified object is saved. On the user side, this generally happens after some form has 
 *     been completely filled. Often, though, the user experience can be improved by having validations occur 
 *     as the form is being filled, so that the user gets more accurate information about which values are 
 *     incorrect and why. In such cases, validation has to be triggered for each field. Always having to write 
 *     the required code (which means catching end of input and synchronizing the model and the view) leads 
 *     to a bunch of redundant code which is hard to maintain
 *   - errors received by validation methods (both individual or global validation methods) must be chained 
 *     manually in their implementation according to the documentation. Not only is this error-prone and
 *     distracting (you end up merging validation code with error-chaining code), it also does not make sense 
 *     if the validation methods need to be called directly (e.g. when validating a text field interactively). 
 *     You could imagine having two sets of validation methods, one performing chaining, the other not, but
 *     this is far from ideal
 *   - global validation for insertion / update is the same, but Core Data lets you implement both separately.
 *     This does not really make sense, the logic should be the same in both cases
 *
 * The HLSValidation class extensions (there are several of them) are meant to solve those issues. Those
 * extensions need to be enabled by calling the HLSEnableNSManagedObjectValidation macro at global scope.
 * When HLSValidation extensions have been enabled, model object validation must be implemented in a 
 * different way:
 *   - instead of implementing 
 *         - (BOOL)validate<fieldName>:(<class> *)pValue error:(out NSError *__autoreleasing *)pError
 *     for each model field to validate, you now implement methods with signature
 *         - (BOOL)check<fieldName>:(<class>)value error:(out NSError *__autoreleasing *)pError
 *     (value can never be of a primitive type here)
 *     As for the 'validate' methods, the 'check' methods are not meant to be called directly (i.e. public)
 *     and should remain hidden in the model object implementation file. If you need to call a validation
 *     method, use one of the check methods available from the HLSValidation category. Note that the first 
 *     parameter of 'check' methods is an object, not an object pointer anymore. The pError pointer is 
 *     guaranteed to be valid (and such that *pError = nil upon method entry), eliminating the need to check it 
 *     before dereferencing it (though in such cases the static analyzer may warn you). You can use this 
 *     pointer to return errors (usually one) which might be encountered during field validation. Those 
 *     errors will automatically be chained for you.
 *   - instead of implementing -validateForUpdate: and -validateForInsert: methods, you now implement a single
 *     -checkForConsistency: method which will be called when an inserted or updated object is saved. As for
 *     individual validations, pError is guaranteed to be valid (with *pError = nil upon method entry), you
 *     therefore do not need to check the pointer before dereferencing it (read remark above, though). Moreover, 
 *     error-chaining will be performed for you. The signature of this method must be
 *         - (BOOL)checkForConsistency:(out NSError *__autoreleasing *)pError
 *   - similarly, instead of implementing the -validateForDelete: method to perform checks when deleting
 *     an object, you now must implement a 'check' method with the following signature:
 *         - (BOOL)checkForDelete:(out NSError *__autoreleasing *)pError
 * UITextField leverage this new set of validation methods by providing binding with model object fields. This 
 * makes synchronization and validation of forms very easy to implement. Refer to UITextField+HLSValidation.h
 * for more information.
 *
 * When validation has been performed and failed, errors are returned. There are only two cases to consider:
 *    - either a single error was encountered, in which case it is simply returned
 *    - several errors have been returned (which might involve several fields and / or objects depending on which
 *      objects are validated, e.g. during a commit), in which case an NSValidationMultipleErrorsError in the
 *      NSCocoaErrorDomain domain is returned. The userInfo dictionary contains an NSDetailedErrorsKey key
 *      storing the array of errors which have been generated.
 *
 * Core Data lets you implement validation logic both using the Core Data model editor and / or by implementing
 * validation methods, as described above. If you define validations both in the xcdatamodel file as well as in 
 * code, the errors generated by the xcdatamodel validation logic will always be combined with those generated 
 * by the manually implemented validations (as an NSValidationMultipleErrorsError) by Core Data. In general, 
 * though, I strongly suggest implementing validations for all fields using one of the following rules exclusively:
 *   - create the field in the xcdatamodel file without changing its default properties (except maybe the default
 *     value setting for numbers, which is enabled by default). Then implement a check method manually
 *   - create the field in the xcdatamodel and set all its validation properties there
 * Ensuring that all validation logic resides in one place is namely easier to understand and maintain.
 * Since the validation logic which can be defined in the xcdatamodel is quite basic, I strongly recommend 
 * defining all validation logic by manually implementing validation methods. This also makes it easier to 
 * localize the application since Core Data error messages are cryptic and not localized.
 * 
 * The magic behind HLSValidation extensions is implemented behind the scene by having usual -validate<fieldName>:error: 
 * methods being created and injected at runtime. Those are wrappers around -check<fieldName>:error: methods which
 * factor out all usual Core Data boilerplate validation code. When you enable HLSValidation class
 * extensions, it is therefore especially important that you NEVER implement 'validate' methods anymore,
 * since this would likely conflict with the methods added at runtime.
