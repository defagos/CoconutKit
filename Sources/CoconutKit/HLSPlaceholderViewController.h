/**
 * View controllers must sometimes embed other view controllers as "subviews". The HLSPlaceholderViewController class 
 * allows you to achieve such embeddings very easily. Simply subclass HLSPlaceholderViewController and define areas where
 * embedded view controllers ("insets") must be drawn, either by binding the placeholder view outlet collection
 * in your subclass nib, or by instantiating them in the -loadView method. If you bind your placeholder views in
 * the nib, be sure to tag them in increasing order, so that the placeholder view with the lowest tag comes first
 * (refer to the placeholderViews property documentation for more information).
 *
 * The inset view controllers can be swapped with other ones at any time. Several built-in transition animations are
 * available when swapping insets, and you can even use custom animations if you want.
 *
 * When a view controller's view is set as inset view controller, its view frame is automatically adjusted to match 
 * its placeholder view bounds, as is the case for usual UIKit containers (UITabBarController, UINavigationController). 
 * Be sure that the view controller's view size and autoresizing behaviors are correctly set.
 *
 * You can preload view controllers into a placeholder view controller before it is displayed. Simply use the
 * -setInsetViewController... methods to load view controllers at specific indices before the placeholder view
 * controller is displayed. You must only ensure that the number of placeholder views suffices to hold all the view 
 * controllers you have preloaded.
 *
 * You can resize or move (even animate!) the placeholder views, even when insets are displayed. This makes the
 * creation of innovative user interfaces as easy as it can be.
 *
 * When you subclass HLSPlaceholderViewController, it is especially important not to forget to call the super class
 * view lifecycle, orientation, animation and initialization methods first if you override any of them, otherwise the 
 * behavior is undefined:
 *   -initWithNibName:bundle:
 *   -initWithCoder: (for view controllers instantiated from a nib)
 *   -awakeFromNib
 *   -viewWill...
 *   -viewDid...
 *   -shouldAutorotate and -supportedInterfaceOrientations
 *
 * You can also use placeholder view controllers with storyboards:
 *   - drop a view controller onto the storyboard, and set its class to a HLSPlaceholderViewController subclass. Add one
 *     or several subviews which you connect to the placeholderViews outlet collection. This defines where inset view 
 *     controllers will be drawn
 *   - drop another view controller onto the storyboard. You can display this view controller as inset as follows:
 *       - if you want to preload the view controller so that it gets displayed when the placeholder view controller
 *         gets displayed, bind the placeholder view controller with it using an HLSPlaceholderInsetSegue with the 
 *         reserved identifier 'hls_preload_at_index_N', where N is the index at which the view controller must be 
 *         displayed. N must be between 0 and 19 (this limit is arbitrary and should be sufficient in practice). The 
 *         transition style which gets applied is HLSTransitionStyleNone and cannot be customized
 *       - if you want to display the view controller after the placeholder view controller has been displayed, use
 *         an HLSPlaceholderInsetSegue (with any non-reserved identifier). If you need to customize the index at which
 *         the view controller must be displayed (by default 0) or the transition settings (style and duration), you 
 *         must implement the -prepareForSegue:sender: method in your source view controller
 *   - if you have several placeholder views, repeat this process as needed
 *   - when you want to install a new inset view controller, you can also bind an existing inset view controller
 *     to it (in other words, the source view controller does not need to be the placeholder view controller, but
 *     can be one of its children). The new inset view controller will be inserted into the placeholder view controller 
 *     the source inset view controller belongs to
 * For further information, refer to the documentation of HLSPlaceholderInsetSegue.
 *
 * About view controller's view reuse:
 * A view controller is retained when set as inset, and released when removed. If no other object keeps a strong reference 
 * to it, it will get deallocated, and so will its view. This is perfectly fine in general since it contributes to saving 
 * resources. But if you need to reuse a view controller's view instead of creating it from scratch again (most likely if 
 * you plan to display it later within the same placeholder view controller), you need to have another object retain the 
 * view controller to keep it alive.
 * For example, you might use a placeholder view controller to switch through a set of view controllers using tabs.
 * If those view controllers bear heavy views, you do not want to have them destroyed when you switch view controllers, 
 * since this would make navigating between tabs slow. In such cases, it makes sense to keep strong references to
 * those view controllers elsewhere (most probably as additional ivars of your placeholder view controller subclass)
