/**
 * This class makes keyboard properties accessible at any time in a convenient way. Just access the +keyboardInformation 
 * method. If the returned object is not nil, then the keyboard is docked and visible (or soon will) and you can check its 
 * properties. The object is nil if the keyboard is floating (iPad) or invisible.
 *
 * You should avoid accessing HLSKeyboardInformation from within keyboard notification callbacks (since keyboard notifications
 * are used to fill HLSKeyboardInformation, the information might be unreliable depending on the order in which notifications
 * callbacks are called)
 *
 * Not meant to be instantiated directly. Simply use the +keyboardInformation class method.
