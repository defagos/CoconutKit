/**
 * Category for easier label localization in nib files. Instead of having to define and bind an outlet just 
 * to localize a UILabel or a UIButton, this category makes it easy to attach a localization key to a label
 * or a button label directly in a nib file. Simply set the text in the nib using one of the following
 * constructs:
 *   - LS/<localizationKey>: Will be replaced by the localized string corresponding to the
 *                           localization key
 *   - ULS/<localizationKey>: Same as LS/, but uppercase
 *   - LLS/<localizationKey>: Same as LS/, but lowercase
 *   - CLS/<localizationKey>: Same as LS/, but capitalized
 *
 * Dynamic localization works both with usual text as well as with attributed text. When attributed text is localized
 * this way, though, only global formatting is preserved though, special formatting applied on subranges is lost.
 *
 * Lookup is performed in the Localizable.strings file of the main bundle. If you need lookup to be performed 
 * in another table, respectively another bundle, set the following user-defined runtime attributes on the 
 * label or button you want to localize:
 *   - locTable: The name of the localization table to use (without the .strings extension). If not set
 *               defaults to Localizable
 *   - locBundle: The name of the bundle to search into (without the .bundle extension). Bundles are searched
 *                recursively in the main bundle, and if locBundle is not set the main bundle is used
 * If none of these parameters are set on the label or the button, the nearest values in the parent view
 * hierarchy are used. This makes it easy to localize a whole screen by having a parent view set the
 * localization table and bundle, labels and buttons within it directly inheriting from these values.
 *
 * It is important to note that when a label has been localized in a nib using one of the above prefixes,
 * the attached localization key cannot be altered anymore. This is not a problem, though, since this
 * approach is intended for "static" labels which are defined once in a nib file and not altered later.
 * If you need to be able to change the text of a label later, do not use prefixes in the nib, use outlets 
 * (after all, if you need to be able to change the text of a label, you probably need an outlet anyway, 
 * which is just what the prefix approach is intended to avoid).
 *
 * Sadly UIBarButtonItem objects cannot be localized this way. Achieving this goal would require messing
 * with a toolbar's view hierarchy, an approach I considered not robust enough to deserve being implemented.
 * Similarly, UISegmentedControl cannot also be localized this way currently.
 *
 * If the key is not found, the localization key itself is used as localized text instead. At runtime, you 
 * can reveal labels for which a localization entry is missing (for the current application language) by using 
 * the provided +setMissingLocalizationsVisible: class method. You can of course still use the NSShowNonLocalizedStrings
 * default setting which logs missing keys to the console if you prefer:
 *   [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setValue:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES] forKey:@"NSShowNonLocalizedStrings"];
 *
 * This category integrates with HLSBundle+HLSDynamicLocalization so that localized labels are updated when the 
 * localization language is changed at runtime.
 *
 * This category currently has some limitations, but which should not be real issues:
 *   - no comment can be provided. This would have been too verbose, and in my experience comments added
 *     to NSLocalizedString macros are not really useful (they are seen by the programmer, not by the translator).
 *     Having them only in the .strings files is what I usually recommend. Tools like Linguan or iLocalize can
 *     help you to add those comments after localization dictionaries have been extracted from the source code
 *   - this brings me to the (currently) really annoying limitation of this category: Automatic localization key 
 *     extraction using genstrings does not work, since genstrings is of course unable to find the constructs
 *     listed above in nib files. I intend to provide a modified genstrings command as part of CoconutKit, this 
 *     should therefore not be a problem anymore soon :-)
